- 👀 I’m interested in Probabilistic Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification and Medical Image Analysis
- 🧠 Also mildly curious about generative models 
- 🔨 Currently working on my master's thesis: [Uncertainty Quantification in Subnetwork Ensemble Methods for Neural Networks](https://github.com/Malthe57/MastersThesis)

When I am not coding, I enjoy
- 🏸 Playing Badminton
- 🎹 Playing Piano (Chopin and Rachmaninoff are my favourite composers!)
